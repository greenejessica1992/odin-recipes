        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>My father and I created this easy 5-ingredient chili recipe and everyone we have made it for loved it. It is fast, simple, and delicious.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>15 ounces tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, drained</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can chili beans, not drained</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chili powder, or to taste</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef  in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in kidney beans, chili beans, and tomato sauce. Bring to a boil and stir in chili powder. Reduce heat to a simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 15 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
        </ol>
